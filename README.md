2. From the program1 directory, open a terminal and run 'python3 server.py' to start the server.
    - This assumes you have python 3 installed
3. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/HelloWorld.html. You browser should display HelloWorld.html.

## Running the server/client
1. Clone the Repository (/program1)
2. From the program1 directory, open a terminal and run 'python3 server.py' to start the server.
    - This assumes you have python 3 installed
